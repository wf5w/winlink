Pat winlink auxilliary programs

## patwinlinkmsgform

Have you ever had the need to create a message for the pat winlink outbox, but don't want to do it in pat winlink? For instance, you are in a Emergency Comms situation where you want people to send message to their loved ones, that they are safe and sound, or messages requesting aid?

In this situation, you can have them create their own message and it will post to the output of pat winlink. Later on, you can send them all.

### prerequistes

* you need yad: $ sudo apt install yad
* you need pat winlink installed, using 73Linux by KM4ACK is a great way to do that.

### configuration

You must edit the file, and replace NOCALL with your own callsign. That's it.
